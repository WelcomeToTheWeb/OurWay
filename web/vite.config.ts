// harness — must proxy both prefixes to the Go server. `dev` and `preview`
// share one object deliberately: the Playwright suite runs against
// `vite preview` on the built bundle, so the proxy it exercises is declared
// here. Production parity is docker/nginx.conf, which proxies the same two
// prefixes.
//
// OURWAY_PROXY_TARGET points the dev/preview proxy at a server on a non-default
// port (the e2e harness runs its own server instance against a throwaway
// database). It has no effect on the built bundle, which only ever uses the
// relative paths.
